1/ @Configuration: 

	The @Configuration annotation indicates that this class declares one or more @Bean methods 
	and may be processed by the spring container to generate bean definitions 
	and service requests for those beans at runtime.

2/ @EnableWebMvc:

	The @EnableWebMvc enables support for the @Controller annotation 
	that uses @RequestMapping to map incomming requests to specific methods.

3/ @ComponentScan:

	The @ComponentScan will instruct spring which packages it may scan to discover spring annotated beans.

4/ InternalResourceViewResolver:

	The InternalResourceViewResolver will prefix and suffix the return value of the controller 
	to construct the real path of the view file.
5/ @Controller: 

	By annotating the class with @Controller annotation – which is a stereo type annotation used to indicate that 
	this is a controller – the dispatcher servlet will automatically map the methods defined in the class 
	using the @RequestMapping annotation.
